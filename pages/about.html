            <h2>Introduction</h2>

              Hi, I'm <strong>Gabriel Levi Ramos</strong>, a junior at

              <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a minor in
              <strong>Business Administration</strong>. I'm passionate about
              <strong>Web App and iOS development</strong>, always seeking new
              challenges and opportunities to grow as a student and

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              I am a dual citizen — born in the United States 🇺🇸 but naturalized
              in Brazil 🇧🇷. I grew up in Curitiba, Paraná, where I attended Bom
              Jesus Aldeia for elementary school and later studied at Bom Jesus
              Centro for high school. Halfway through high school, I had the
              opportunity to transfer to CATS Academy Boston, where I completed
              my studies. Now, I’m pursuing a degree in Computer Science at
              Boston University, with a minor in Business Administration.
